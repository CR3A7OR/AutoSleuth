My Bachelor level project which is split into two main individual yet cooperative parts:

Part 1:
- Project it is focused on the retrieval of a complete and correct copy of a device's internal storage media using a rubber ducky designed device written in Ducky Script to then be sent over HTTPS using a Rust executable to a server with a custom PHP listener running saving it as a cloned image file. 

Part 2:
- Project was the automated analysis of the retrieved disk image using a Python script generating a report with the results
